# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called zip lists

Arguments: 2 linked lists

Return: New Linked List zipped 

Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(n) (linear time complexity) where n is the number of the element in the linked list.

O(1) space complexity, as we are just modifying the already existing linked lists
