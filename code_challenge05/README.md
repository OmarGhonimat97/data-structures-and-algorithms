# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Singly Linked List, has two pointers, pointing to the current and the next node.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This challenge requires building a linked list class, and adding three methods to the linked list:
- insert >> for adding a node (value) to the beginning of the linked list
- includes >> which searches for a certain value in the linked list and return true if found or false if not
- to string >> which returns a string representing all the values in the linked list. 


## Approach & Efficiency

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
1. append >> adds a node to the END of the linked list, it iterates over the list until the last node is found,
and adds the new node after it.
2. inset >> adds a node to the beginning of the linked list.
3. includes >> iterates over the nodes in the liked list and returns true if the
required value exists and false if the value does not exist in the linked list.
4. to string >> returns a string representing all the values in the linked list
